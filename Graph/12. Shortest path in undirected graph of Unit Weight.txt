The idea behind this is to use BFS, as BFS will explore all the nodes in a parallel manner. We just need to modify it a little.

We need to keep track of the distance of each node from the source node and at last we will get the shortest path
of all the nodes from the source node.

We will push the source node with the distance 0 into the queue and then start the BFS traversal from it unitl the 
queue is not empty. And if the distance of any node is found to be less than the previous node distance + the distance to 
it(edge weight), then we will update the new distance and this is known as relaxation.

TC = O(V+E)
SC = O(V)
