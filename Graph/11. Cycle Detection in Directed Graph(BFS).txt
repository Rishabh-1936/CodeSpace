There is different concept for detecting cycle in Directed graphs, as checking for the closed loop is not the factor for cycle detection.
Because a closed is only formed when the direction of all the nodes are making a circular loop. So the concept of checking the
parent is not applicable(that is if the parent of the adjacent node is different then it means there is a loop.)

So in BFS we will use Kahn's algorithm for detecting the cycle, as for Kahn's algorithm the graph need to be a DAG.
So we can reverse the concept of for using Kahn's algorithm i.e topological sort graph need to be DAG, so we can use it
as if the graph is not sorted topologically then it is cyclic.

Algorithm:
1.Apply Kahn's algorithm.
2.Check at last if the number of elements pushed to queue is same as the total number of vertices or not.
