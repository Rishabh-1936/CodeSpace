As the travesal for shortest path in directed is very different from that of undirected, as in undirected, it is possible to
traverse the whole graph/component starting from any node. But this is not the case with directed graph.

So for directed graph we need to first know the order in which the nodes can be visited. The shortest distance can only 
be found:

1. when the shortest distance of the current node from the source one has been calculated yet if it is possible.

2. When all the nodes from where it can be reached are travesed and their shortest distance is calculated before the 
current node, as if it is not so then the nodes from which the current node can be reached will be having the shortest
distance INFINITY only.

So topological sort will be used to find the order in which the nodes can be traversed.
