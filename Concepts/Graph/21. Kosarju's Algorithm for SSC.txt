Kosarju's Algorithm helps to the find all the strongly connected components in a directed graph.

A strongly connected component is a component in which every node is reachable from any other node.

    1 -* 2 -* 4
    *    /    |
    |   *     *
      3       5

Here, 1-2-3 is a SSC, 4 is a SSC and 5 is a SSC. So total 3 SSC are there in the above graph.

There are 3 steps in Kosarju's Algorithm to find all SSCs:
1.  Sort all the nodes according to the order of their finishing time (Topological Sort), and store the order into the stack.
2.  Transpose the graph.(means reverse the direction of all the edges).
3.  Perform DFS on the Transpose graph according to the finishing time of the nodes evaluated in the step-1.

T.C :   TC step1 + TC step2 + TC step3 
        O(N+E) + O(N+E) + O(N+E) ~ O(N+E) 
        
        
S.C :   SC for graph + visited array + stack
        O(N+E) + O(N) + O(N) ~ O(N)
