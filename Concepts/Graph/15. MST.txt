MST is Minimum Spanning Tree. Whenever a tree with N nodes and N-1 edges with the minimum weight is created from the 
graph that tree such that it is possible to reach every node from every other node with the minimal posssible edge weight, 
such tree is known as MST. 

There are many MST possible for a single graph.

There is no cycle (as it is a tree even if it has minimum edge weight also) as there is no cycle in the tree.

The algorithms to detect whether a tree is a MST or not:

1. Prims Algorithm
2. Kruskal Algorithm
