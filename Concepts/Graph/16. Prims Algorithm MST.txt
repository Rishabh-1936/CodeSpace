Prims Algorithm: 
----------------

Starting with the one node(like a source node) andd then proceeding with the adjacent nodes which are having the minimal 
weight. Once all the nodes are created with the fulfillment of all criteriia of the MST then we got the MST.

We need 3 arrays let it be:
1. key:     initialized with infinity. It is used to store the edge weight associated with the node.
            (The weight stored in key array is only the edge weight b/w the curent node and it's adjacent node. 
            Used for picking up the nodde with minimum edge weight.)
2. mst:     initialized with false. It is used to keep the track of nodes which are the part of the current MST(or treat is as a visited array).
3. parent:  initialized with -1. It is used to store the parent of the nodes so as to avoid/check for cycle. It is also
            used for the creation of the final MST. 

========================================================================================================================

Algorithm:
----------
1. Mark the weight of the source node as 0, mst as T and parent -1.

2. Now traverse the adjacent of the node whose weight is minimum in the key array and update the parent array and weight array
   as per the information. Don't update the mst array till this step.

3. Now traverse the key array and pickup the node with minimum weight and if it is not forming a cycle then consider that in
   the current MST by marking it as 'T' in mst array.

4. Whenever the key array is updated, then update the parent array also, with the minimum possible weight.

5. Select the node with minimum value in the key array and mark the value true in the MST array
   and traverse its adjacent nodes and update the key and parent array. Repeat these steps until all the nodes in the
   MST array is marked as 'True'.
