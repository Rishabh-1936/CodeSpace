1. Bipartite graph in general are the graph that can be coloured using 2 colors such that no 2 adjacent nodes have the same color.

2. It is also called bi-graph.

3. Bipartite graph is equivalent to 2-colorable graph.

4. All Acyclic graphs are Bipartite.

5. A cyclic graph is Bipartite iff all its cycles are of even length.

6. If there is any odd length cyclic then that graph cannot be Bipartite. 

7. As per the bookish defination, a Bipartite graph is a set of graph vertices, i.e, points where multiple lines meet, 
   decomposed into 2 disjoint sets. The vertices are divided into 2 independent sets where every edge connects are vertex  
   from both disjoint/independent sets.

8. A Bipartite graph is a  special case of k-partite graph where k=2.

9. A graph with no edges i.e n components is also Bipartite graph.

10. According to the Bipartite condition, all edges should be from one set to another.

11. BFS and DFS both can be used to check whether the graph is Bipartite or not with T.C = O(V+E)

12. Every tree is a Bipartite graph.
